CloudSim_DVFS
=============

Experiments with the DVFS implementation of CloudSim

The code is provided by: http://www.cloudbus.org/cloudsim/.
This simulator was created by Tom Guerout et al.:
Tom Guerout, Thierry Monteil, Georges Da Costa, Rodrigo N. Calheiros, Rajkumar Buyya, Mihai Alexandru. Energy-aware simulation with DVFS. Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory, Volume 39, pages 76-91, December 2013.

We extended the algorithms for energy-aware scheduling and presented the results in:
Watanabe, E.N.; Campos, P.P.V.; Braghetto, K.R.; Macedo Batista, D., "Energy Saving Algorithms for Workflow Scheduling in Cloud Computing", The 2014 Brazilian Symposium on Computer Networks and Distributed Systems (SBRC) , pp.9,16, 5-9 May 2014.
